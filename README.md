2. **FluentCart calls** `makePaymentFromPaymentInstance()` 
3. **SslcommerzProcessor** prepares payment data
4. **API call** initializes payment with SSL Commerz
5. **Customer redirected** to SSL Commerz (hosted) or popup opens (modal)
6. **Customer pays** on SSL Commerz's secure platform
7. **SSL Commerz IPN** notifies your site
8. **SslcommerzWebhook** validates payment with SSL Commerz API
9. **FluentCart** completes the order

## Testing

### Test Mode

1. Enable **Test Mode** in settings
2. Use test Store ID and Password from SSL Commerz
3. Use [test cards](https://developer.sslcommerz.com/doc/v4/#test-cards) provided by SSL Commerz

### Test Cards

See SSL Commerz documentation for test card numbers:
https://developer.sslcommerz.com/doc/v4/#test-cards

## Important Notes

### Currency Requirements

- Primary currency should match your SSL Commerz account currency
- For Bangladesh merchants, use BDT as primary currency
- Multi-currency support available based on your SSL Commerz account setup

### Refunds

SSL Commerz refunds must be processed manually through the SSL Commerz merchant dashboard. Automated refunds are not supported by SSL Commerz API.

### Subscriptions

SSL Commerz does not support automated recurring billing. This plugin supports **manual subscriptions** by:

- Creating FluentCart subscriptions with `collection_method = manual` when paid via SSL Commerz.
- Letting FluentCart's invoice scheduler generate renewal invoices for each billing cycle.
- Charging each renewal invoice as a normal one-time SSL Commerz payment.

Customers must pay each invoice manually; SSL Commerz never auto-charges on your behalf.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Payment initialization fails**
   - Check Store ID and Password are correct
   - Verify you're using correct mode (test/live)
   - Check SSL Commerz account status

2. **IPN not received**
   - Verify your site is publicly accessible
   - Check webhook URL is correct
   - Test IPN using SSL Commerz dashboard tools

3. **Payment shows pending after success**
   - Manually trigger IPN from SSL Commerz dashboard
   - Check IPN logs in FluentCart

### Debug Logging

Add to `wp-config.php`:

```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```

Check logs at `wp-content/debug.log`
